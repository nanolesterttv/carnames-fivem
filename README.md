# Installation

Put the script in your resources folder.

Start the script in the server.cfg 

**ensure carnames-fivem**

Go inside **vehicle_names.lua** 

You can copy and paste AddTextEntry("Spawncode", "Put the name here")


# Information

How this script works is it updates the string in the vehicles.meta file to change the name!


**NOTE IF YOU REMOVE THE SCRIPT THE NAME DOESNT STAY**
